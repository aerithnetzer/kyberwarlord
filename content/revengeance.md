I recently finally played _Metal Gear Rising Rising: Renvengeance_ for the first time in many years. I think this is one of the rare games that is also a political object. Clearly, amongst the absolute buck-wild music and turning men into hamburger meat, there is a message being communicated. It sits amongst games like _Spec Ops: The Line_, wherein the game forces you, **as yourself**, not as a character, to come to terms with the violence you do against fictional men and women.

The game plays linearlyâ€”it is not open-world at all. I think this is where the games genre and gameplay style adds to the storytelling. The men that occupy the world are all on an inevitable collision course with one-another. There will be bloodshed, as sure as the sun will rise tomorrow. There is no alternative. Per the endlessly-repeated speech by Monsoon:

> Free will is a myth. Religion is a joke. We are all pawns, controlled by something greater. Memes, the DNA of the soul. They shape our will. They are the culture. They are everything we pass on.
