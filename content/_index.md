This is Aerith Netzer's blog, _Kyberwarlord_, it is an occasional blog that is mostly text-only. I post book and music reviews occasionally.

## About Me

I am a librarian with all my heart. I do a little bit of everything as a librarian except do any _actual_ librarianship. That does not mean I am not busy! I write code for a [couple](https://bulletin.appliedtransstudies.org/) [journals](https://www.rplrt.org/), and do [research](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/18368) to make the publishing process easier. I also do data science/ML/AI work for the humanities! I bring big data perspectives to humanities conversations.
